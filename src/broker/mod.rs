//
//Whilst broker is implemented within this package as a singular broker, the intention of these
//traits is to hide the implementation from the user so that it could be one or a combination of
//brokers returning the data. Similarly, strategy implementations should not create any
//dependencies on the underlying state of the broker.
//
///Represents functionality that all brokers have to support in order to perform any backtests at
///all. Implementations may choose not to implement some part of this functionality but this trait
///represents a general base case.
///
///In practice, the only optional trait that seems to be included often is [GetsQuote]. This is not
///included in the base definition because turning the broker into both a source and user of data
///is implementation-dependent.
///
///This confusion in the implementation is also why get_position_value requires mutation: broker
///not only asks for prices but keeps state about prices so that we can find a valuation for the
///security if we are missing a price for the current date. At some point, we make relax this
///mutability constraint.
///
///Clients should not be able to call debit or credit themselves. Deposits or withdrawals are
///implemented through [TransferCash] trait.
