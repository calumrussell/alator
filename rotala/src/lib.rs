//! # What is Rotala?
//!
//! Rotala provides exchange back=ends against which users can run backtests. The standard
//! mechanism for creating and running a backtest is the JSON server but users can also import a
//! lib. The lib is intended to be used primarily for testing and creating examples within Rust.
//! Implementations of front-end code using the Rotala lib are in the Alator library.
//!
//! Rotala is at an early-stage in development. Most of the components used in the article were
//! already in-use in a predecessor application. The separation of responsibilities within this
//! library are still being worked out so the large number of abstractions currently in use may
//! reduce.
//!
//! # Implementation
//!
//! A single exchange implementation is composed of:
//! - An input, [Penelope](crate::input::penelope::Penelope) is an example. The input produces
//! quotes and will define the format of quotes that exchanges wishing to use the source must use.
//! - An orderbook implementation, [Diana](crate::orderbook::diana::Diana) is an example. The
//! orderbook contains the core execution logic and defines the format of orders and trades. This
//! is distinct from an exchange as the an orderbook could be LOB, could use candles, etc. And this
//! varies in a distinct way from the interface presented to clients.
//! - An exchange implementation, [Uist](crate::exchange::uist::UistV1) is an example. In terms of
//! code, this ends up being a fairly thin wrapper depending more on the kind of clients than
//! the actual execution logic used by the orderbook. To explain more from above, the
//! exchange is the external interface that provides a set of possible operations to users and does
//! not concern itself too closely with how things are implemented (but it does have to bind to s
//! single orderbook implementation). Uist, for example, has a lot of additional methods concerning
//! orchestration and how clients can match state with exchange.
//! - The server implementation of the exchange returning JSON responses over the exchange impl.
//! - The client implementation of the exchange which provides a Rust API for the server, as much
//! for documenting how clients can call the server.
//!
//! In addition to all this, we have data sources which call some external source and are bound into
//! the exchange: for example, the Uist exchange can be created using a Binance input.
//!
//! The proliferation of abstractions is to offer users the most flexibility but this is going to be
//! subject to change as I learn more about this application.
//!
//! # Uist
//!
//! Interface to Uist is defined in [UistClient](crate::client::uist::UistV1Client).
//!
//! The flow of Uist is:
//! - init called at start, this returns some information about the dataset
//! - loop
//!     - fetch_quotes, returns price information for current date
//!     - insert_order/delete_order
//!     - tick, returning whether there is another tick and trades executed on the last tick
//!
//! Uist has no client identifiers. It is possible to run more than one strategy against Uist but
//! it is not advisable as it will be difficult to work out which trades are allocated to each
//! strategy. The server does support concurrent execution but without client identifiers it isn't
//! possible to return a properly synchronized result.
//!
//! Order_id is only set once order is passed into the orderbook. Exchange only passes trades to
//! orderbook once tick is called and these pending orders will be re-ordered so that sells are
//! executed before buys. Order_id does not always reflect execution priority.
//!
//! Once an order is inserted, it cannot be deleted on the same tick as an order only gets an id
//! once it is passed into the orderbook.
//!
//! ``
//! cargo run --bin uist_server_v1 [ipv4_address] [port]
//! ``
//!
//! # Development priorities
//!
//! Short-term:
//! - Add example code showing a strategy running in Python.
//! - Add more external data sources
//! - Add more binaries with servers loading external data
//! - Add another exchange so separation of concerns is clearer
//!
//! Long-term:
//! - Add orderbook with L2 data, this is going to require L2 sources
