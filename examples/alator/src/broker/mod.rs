//! Issues orders to exchange and tracks changes as exchange executes orders. Contains a set of
//! traits that represent common operations, and a full test implementation of a broker.
//!
//! ### Traits
//!
//! In order to use the traits, exchange common types must implement broker traits:
//! - [BrokerTrade]
//! - [BrokerQuote]
//! - [BrokerEvent]
//!
//! It is also assumed that any exchange supports at least the order types in [BrokerOrderType].
//!
//! The traits have been created to provide code for operations that are common across brokers. It
//! is likely that the traits that touch some of the order logic (for example, [BrokerOperations]
//! ) are too tightly bound to the exchange implementation to be useful across brokers.
//!  
//! Broker can hold negative cash values due to the non-immediate execution of trades. Once a
//! broker has received the notification of completed trades and finds a negative value then
//! re-balancing is triggered automatically. Responsibility for moving the portfolio back to the
//! correct state is left with owner, broker implementations take responsibility for correcting
//! invalid internal state (like negative cash values).
//!
//! If a series has high levels of volatility between periods then performance will fail to
//! replicate the strategy due to continued rebalancing.
//!
//! To minimize the distortions due to rebalancing behaviour, the broker will target a minimum
//! cash value. This is currently set at an arbitrary level, 1_000, as this is something library
//! dependent and potentially difficult to explain.
//!
//! If a portfolio has a negative value, the current behaviour is to continue trading potentially
//! producing unexpected results. Previous versions would exit early when this happened but this
//! behaviour was removed.
//!
//! Cash balances are held in single currency which is assumed to be the same currency used across
//! the simulation.
//!
//! Certain calculations, for example cost basis, require keeping an internal log of trades. This is
//! distinct from performance calculations.
//!
//! ### Uist
//!
//! Broker using non-networked [Uist](rotala::exchange::uist::UistV1) exchange. Uses the [Penelope](rotala::input::penelope::Penelope)
//! input format and requires a reference to the [Clock](rotala::clock::Clock) that is shared with
//! exchange (this can be created with input using builders).
//!
//! Should use [UistBrokerBuilder](crate::broker::uist::UistBrokerBuilder) to create. Can create
//! with optional [BrokerCost].

/// Once the broker moves into Failed state then all operations that mutate state are rejected.
///
/// This flag is intended to cover any situation where the broker moves into a state where it is
/// unclear how to move the state foward. In most cases, and contrary to the intuition with this
/// kind of error, this will be due to errors with the strategy code and the interaction with
/// external state (i.e. price source).
///
/// Once this happens, the broker will stop performing cash transactions and issuing orders. The
/// broker won't throw an error once this happens and will continue reading from exchange to
/// reconcile trades/liquidate current position in order to return a correct cash balance to the
/// strategy. If the price source is missing data after a liquidation is triggered then it is
/// possible for incorrect results to be returned.
///
/// The most common scenario for this state to be triggered is due to bad strategy code triggering
/// the liquidation process and the broker being unable to find sufficient cash (plus a buffer of
/// 1000, currently hardcoded).
///
/// A less common scenario contrived to demonstrate how this can occur due to external data: we
/// have a portfolio with cash of 100, the strategy issues a market order for 100 shares @ 1,
/// the market price doubles on the next tick, and so the exchange asks for 200 in cash to settle
/// the trade. Once this happens, it is unclear what the broker should do so we move into an error
/// condition and stop mutating more state.
///
